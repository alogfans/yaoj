# Yet Another Online Judge 2

A light-weighted online judge system based on Django Framework. Authored by Alogfans.

It supoorted some features:
* Bootstrap-based interface with a special-designed theme.
* Code style checker poweredby Google Inc.
* Markdown-based programming description page, which help the administrator to modify problems and announcements without learning much about the details of HTML5 and CSS.
* Allow a kind of special judge: you just need to complete a function (procedure) and others we have done. It may be helpful in some area.

## Installation
We'll release an automatically installation package.
